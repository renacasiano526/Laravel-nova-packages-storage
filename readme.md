# Nova Packages

## Setting up Passport

1. `php artisan passport:keys`
2. `php artisan passport:client --personal`

## Setting up Scout

1. Make a new [Algolia app](https://www.algolia.com/)
2. From your Algolia app, copy the Admin API key and ID into your `.env`. If you see a "Not enough rights to update an object near line:1 error when seeding your database, you're using the Search-Only keyâ€”swap it out for the Admin key.
3. In your Algolia app, create a new index called "packages".
4. After seeding your database, run `php artisan scout:import "App\Package"`

## Seeding the Database

1. `php artisan db:seed`

## Setting up GitHub Authentication

1. Make a new [GitHub OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Set `http://novapackages.test/login/github/callback` as the Authorized Callback URL
3. Copy the GitHub app id and secret to `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

## Setting up Slack Test Webhook

1. Add the `SLACK_URL` variable to your `.env` to post to a Slack channel of your choosing.

**Note:** This webhook is hit when certain events are fired. If you are not testing this webhook specifically, you may want to consider commenting it out to avoid sending unnecessary Slack notifications.

## Setting up the Filesystem for Screenshots

1. Run `php artisan storage:link`

## Testing

The tests in `tests/Feature/RepoTest.php` provide coverage for the readme import feature. These tests depend on an active Internet connection and will run by default. For convenience, they have been added to the `integration` group. If you would like to exlude these tests from running, you may do so by using phpunit's `--exclude-group` option


```
phpunit --exclude-group=integration
```
